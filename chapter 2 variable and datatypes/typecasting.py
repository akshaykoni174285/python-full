a = "2345"
# now this variable is a string and if we want to do some operation on this number we have to cahnge the data type of this variable 
# and that is called type casting in python

a = int(a)
# this is goonna change the data type of this variable in the int type

print(type(a))
print(a+17)
# and then you can add some number to this value
